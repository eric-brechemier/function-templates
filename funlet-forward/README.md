# Forward Funlet

This Twilio Function is based on the [Twimlet of the same name][twimlet].

[twimlet]: https://www.twilio.com/labs/twimlets/forward

It can be used as a drop-in replacement for the Twimlet, by using the URL
of the Twilio Function as a webhook with the same GET parameters.

Alternatively, it can be customized by setting properties in the
environment. GET and POST parameters are considered first, if provided,
then environment properties, then config properties declared in the script.

Environment properties are most convenient when you are using a single
instance of this script in your account. To customize multiple instances,
the recommended way is to modify the script parameters in the config object,
directly in the script.

## Stages

The Forward Funlet has two stages:

| Stage | Addressing | Description |
| ----: | :--------- | :---------- |
|     1 | Caller     | Check that caller is allowed and forward the call |
|     2 | Caller     | After a failed call, redirect to fallback URL, if any |

These two stages would typically be implemented in two separate Twilio
Functions. In the Forward Funlet, they are running in two separate
instances of the same Twilio Function. This is in line with the original
Forward Twimlet, which implemented both stages in the same script.
